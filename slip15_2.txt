Q.2) Create Angular application that print the name of students who got 85% using
filter and map method

Step 1: Set up the Angular component
First, create an Angular component named StudentListComponent. This component
will contain an array of student data and will display only those students who scored
85% or above.
bash
Copy code
ng generate component StudentList
Step 2: Define Student Data and Filtering Logic
In the student-list.component.ts file, define the student data array and
use filter and map to get the names of students who scored 85% or more.
typescript
Copy code
// student-list.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
selector: 'app-student-list',
templateUrl: './student-list.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./student-list.component.css']
})
export class StudentListComponent {
// Sample student data
students = [
{ id: 1, name: 'Alice', score: 90 },
{ id: 2, name: 'Bob', score: 70 },
{ id: 3, name: 'Charlie', score: 85 },
{ id: 4, name: 'David', score: 88 }
];
// Filter and map to get the names of students who scored 85 or more
topStudents = this.students

.filter(student => student.score >= 85)
.map(student => student.name);
}
Step 3: Display the Filtered Data in the Template
In student-list.component.html, iterate over the topStudents array and display each
name.
html
Copy code
<!-- student-list.component.html -->
<div>
<h3>Students who scored 85% or higher:</h3>
<ul>
<li *ngFor="let studentName of topStudents">{{ studentName }}</li>
</ul>
</div>
Explanation
 filter: This method filters out students who have a score less than 85.
 map: After filtering, map extracts only the name property of each student who
passed the filter criteria.
Step 4: Add the Component to the Main Application Template
Include the app-student-list selector in your main app.component.html to display the
component.
html
Copy code
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-student-list></app-student-list>
Expected Output
The application will display the names of students who scored 85% or above:
diff
Copy code
Students who scored 85% or higher:
- Alice
- Charlie
